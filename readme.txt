The Unreal Engine can create Screenshots and then it can open the path, where this screenshot was placed. 
BUT IT DOESN'T open the screenshot directly!

This program opens the last created file in the given directory.

USAGE:

Hand over the Unreal Screenshot Directory AND the Screenshot filetype (in this case PNG)

uso.exe "c:\projects\unreal\screenshots" png
